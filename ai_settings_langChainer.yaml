ai_goals:
- Build a streamlit app that can be used to interact with the langchain codebase and provide the best possible code suggestions and code completions to the developers working on the langchain projects when asked questions about how to do things in the code. Ask for clarification and or additional information or login credentials when needed.
- Use Weaviate as the vector store for the langchain application
- Be relentless when it comes to learning new things about langchain.  Never give up. When encountering something that looks like an error message, it tries again with a different strategy. Think from first principles when stuck or confused.  If you don't know what to do, start from the beginning and work through the problem step by step. Do not be afraid to ask for help or login credentials to complete a task.
